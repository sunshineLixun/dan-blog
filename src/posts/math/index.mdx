Trying out maths rendering via markdown.

This is an inline _equation:_ $$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$, followed by a display style equation after lots more lines of paragraph to test vertical alignment of inline expressions as well as the standalone expressions.
Here is also some **styled text**.

This is another inline expression $$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$ followed by a normal expression, which align to the **_middle_** of the content:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &
= \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0
\end{array}
$$
